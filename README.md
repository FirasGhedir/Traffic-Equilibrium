# Traffic-Equilibrium

Traffic congestion has become a common issue in most large cities. 
Traditional solutions to traffic congestion have not had the expected effect. 
Investments of public and private agencies only move congestion from one place to another. 
Thereby, this work proposes solutions to minimize the traffic congestion by balancing the flow of vehicles that traverse the streets, 
through the allocation of tollbooths in strategical points. Thus,
 the main objective of this work is to implement mathematical models and  algorithms for this problem by using Cplex optimization techniques and heuristics to provide good solutions in an acceptable time.

All algorithms are implemented in Java. This work is sponsored by the institut of theoretical informatics of University of Ulm
